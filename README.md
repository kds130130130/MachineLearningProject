Programs used for my machine learning research.

__DQNattempt__ creates customizable game environments for agents with their own Deep Q-networks to learn to play.
Produces csv files containing data about the agent's actions and behavior.

Based on the program from: https://pythonprogramming.net/deep-q-learning-dqn-reinforcement-learning-python-tutorial/

__Chartmaker__ automates the process of making charts from csv files produced by DQNattempt.

Currently a work in progress.
